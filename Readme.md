This is a testing system developed for my employee company "Gujurly Nesil" (GN) in Ashgabat / Turkmenistan.
It is going to be used mainly in computer labs for midterms of our term students, for level testing of guests to be registered to next course.

The app is going to let teachers prepare their own test banks, test papers with 5 types of questions
  - Multiple choice (single answer)
  - Multiple answer
  - Fill in the gaps
  - Matching type questions.
  - Writing question
